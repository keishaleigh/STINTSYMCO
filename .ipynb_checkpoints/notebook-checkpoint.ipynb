It is primarily geared towards the estimation of the levels of employment and unemployment in the country. One of the objectives of the Labor Force Survey is to provide a quantitative framework for the preparation of plans and formulation of policies affecting the labor market. Specifically, the survey is designed to provide statistics on levels and trends of employment, unemployment and underemployment of the country, as a whole, and for the 17 administrative regions.

    "\n",
    "The PSA collects the LFS data through quarterly household surveys using face-to-face interviews. The survey employs a multi-stage sampling design to ensure that the sample accurately represents the population. The key steps in the data collection process include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sampling frame creation: The PSA uses a master sample list derived from the 2015 Census of Population and Housing (CPH) as the sampling frame.\n",
    "2. Random selection of households: Households are randomly selected within each stratum (region or province) to create a representative sample.\n",
    "3. Face-to-face interviews: Field interviewers visit the sampled households and collect data through structured questionnaires.\n",
    "4. Data validation and processing: The collected data undergoes validation and consistency checks before being aggregated and published.\n",
    "\n",
    "The multi-stage sampling design of the Labor Force Survey (LFS) ensures representativeness across regions, but certain limitations exist. Non-response rates and inaccuracies in self-reported data may introduce bias, particularly in income-related features. Since the survey is conducted quarterly, it captures seasonal employment trends, which may affect the generalizability of insights over longer periods. Additionally, recall bias or misreporting could impact data reliability. Despite these limitations, the LFS remains a valuable source for policy-making and labor market analysis, providing key insights into the employment landscape of the Philippines."

    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "The dataset is organized into two main sections:\n",
    "- **ID Items (_IDS0)** - Metadata and household identifiers\n",
    "- **Household Members (HHMEM)** - Individual member data with **demographic, education, and employment** details.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rows and Columns\n",
    "Each **row** represents a *household member* (not an entire household). I.E. if a household has 5 people, there will be 5 rows for that household.\n",
    "Each **column** represents a specific feature (e.g. age, sex, occupation).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Breakdown\n",
    "- **_IDS0 section:** 4 columns\n",
    "- **HHMEM section:** 43 columns\n",
    "\n",
    "The total feature count then comes out to **47**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### File Setup\n",
    "The dataset consists of two main files: a single CSV file that contains all of the data, and an Excel worksheet that serves as a dictionary that defines each column as well as possible values of each column.\n",
    "- **LFS PUF April 2016.csv**\n",
    "- **lfs_april_2016_metadata(dictionary).xlsx**\n",
